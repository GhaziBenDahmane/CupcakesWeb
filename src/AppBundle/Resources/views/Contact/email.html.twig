Dear {{ nom }}:

I'd like to welcome you to CupCakes Ben Dahmen. We are excited that you have accepted our job offer and agreed upon your start date. I trust that this letter finds you mutually excited about your new employment with (Name of Company).

As mentioned during the interviews, while your new position reports to me, I'd like to welcome you to the (Name of Department) on behalf of all of the staff.

Each of us will play a role to ensure your successful integration into the department.

We're expecting you for new employee orientation on (Date), Tuesday at 9 a.m. You will meet with me to discuss your successful integration into our company and with Human Resources staff to learn about employment related issues. You'll also meet with several coworkers so you can get a feel for the overall work of the department. Our dress code is casual.

Your new team anticipates taking you out to lunch to get to know you and to make sure that you meet everyone with whom you will be working. Your meeting agenda, for the rest of your first day, will involve planning your orientation with me and setting some initial work goals so that you feel immediately productive in your new role.

I anticipate that your second day will involve more coworker meetings to understand the department. You'll also have the opportunity to continue with your new employee orientation plan and your initial work for the department.

Again, welcome to the team. If you have questions prior to your start date, please call me at any time, or send me an email, if that is more convenient. We look forward to having you come on board.

Regards,

Name of the Department Manager / Boss
